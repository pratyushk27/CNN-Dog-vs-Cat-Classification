# CNN-Dog-vs-Cat-Classification

# Introduction:
In this project, we will develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of dogs and cats. The dataset we'll be using is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which consists of labeled images of dogs and cats. We'll leverage the power of deep learning to create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between these two classes.

# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can effectively classify images as either a dog or a cat with high accuracy.

* Steps:

# Dataset Acquisition:

* Download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle, a collection of labeled images of dogs and cats.
* Save the dataset in a specific folder in my Google Drive for easy access.
* drive link of dataset-- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MX13utyB08qYKGo9qD6FGxyHPQF3p3kU/view?usp=drive_link

# Data Preparation:

* Mount my Google Drive in a Google Colab notebook to access the dataset.
* Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
* Preprocess the images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
* Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

# Model Development:

* Build a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
* Design the architecture of the CNN, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
* Compile the model with an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.
* Train the model using the training dataset and validate its performance using the validation dataset.
* Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and architecture to improve performance if necessary.

* Model Evaluation:
 - Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to assess its generalization performance.
* Deployment:
 -Deploy the trained model to predict the presence of a cat in practical scenarios using cat images..

# Conclusion:
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN models for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. By leveraging deep learning techniques and the vast amount of data available in the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, we seek to create a robust and accurate classifier capable of distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.
